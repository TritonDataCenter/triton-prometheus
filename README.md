# triton-prometheus

A repo with tooling to setup Prometheus and Grafana in a TritonDC
for metrics and monitoring of Triton itself.

## Status

For now this is just notes and merged bash scripts from JoshW,
Dylan, and Trent. Eventually this might turn into a core TritonDC
"prometheus" service (or even two separate ones for each of
Prometheus and Grafana).
