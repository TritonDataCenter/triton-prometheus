# (Re-)generate the Prometheus config and, if changed, (re)start prometheus.
#
# It is expected that this is run via the config-agent "prometheus" manifest
# `post_cmd` (see "/opt/triton/prometheus/sapi_manifests/prometheus").
# However, running it directly is supported as well.
#

#
# Dev Notes:
# - Do we need retries on requests to CNS? Probably yes. Currently determining
#   the default CMON URL and resolv.conf update for the dev config is brittle
#   by being dependent on the CNS service being up.
